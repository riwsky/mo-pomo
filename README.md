Once upon a time, a guy used random [pomodoro timers](http://pomodorotechnique.com) he found on the internet.

Every day, he would go slightly over one of the time segments, and want to check how long he went over, and then be annoyed when the random timers provided no means to do so. Also they loaded slow and had too many buttons.

Until one day, he realized "wait, instead of complaining, I could just solve my own problem".

So he solved it.
